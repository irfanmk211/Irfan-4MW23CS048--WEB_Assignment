      <h2>Projects</h2>

      <h3>Quiz Management and Result Analysis Web Application</h3>
      <p>
        A web-based Quiz Management System developed as an academic project to simplify conducting
        online quizzes and evaluating student performance. The system supports three roles:
        <strong>Admin</strong>, <strong>Teacher</strong>, and <strong>Student</strong>. Admin can
        create and manage teacher and student accounts. Teachers can log in to create quizzes, add
        multiple-choice questions, set correct answers and marks, and schedule quizzes for specific
        student groups. Students can view available quizzes, attempt them within the given time,
        and submit responses online.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system automatically evaluates answers, calculates total marks, and displays a detailed
        result summary to students, including correct and incorrect responses. Quiz attempts are
        stored in a database, and teachers can see basic analytics such as highest score, average
        score, and number of attempts for each quiz. The project uses
        <strong>Django (Python)</strong> for the backend,
        <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery</strong> for the frontend, and
        <strong>SQLite/MySQL</strong> as the database.
      </p>

      <h3>Graph Theory Visualizations using Python & NetworkX</h3>
      <p>
        Implemented basic graph algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS),
        shortest path, and minimum spanning tree using Python and the NetworkX library. Visualized
        different graph structures to support coursework assignments in Graph Theory.
      </p>

      <h3>Matrix Transpose using Serial and Parallel Implementation (OpenMP)</h3>
      <p>
        Developed programs to compute matrix transpose using both serial and parallel (OpenMP-based)
        implementations. Compared the performance of the two approaches as part of an Analysis and
        Design of Algorithms (ADA) assignment.
      </p>

      <h3>Static Resume and Bio-data Website</h3>
      <p>
        Created this multi-page personal website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. The site
        includes separate pages for Resume and Bio-data, with a dark/light theme toggle implemented
        using jQuery.
